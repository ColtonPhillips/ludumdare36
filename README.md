# Ludum Dare 36 - "Ancient Technology"

Our 2 player game is influenced by "Scorched Earth (DOS)" and has you comedically hurling obsolete fax machines at your opponent. Accuracy and speed are required to defeat your enemy. Game Maker Studio was used for rapid prototyping and development. As this was not a solo project, it was submitted under the "Jam" category.
